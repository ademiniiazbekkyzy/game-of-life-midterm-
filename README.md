# Game of life
## Simulation rules
The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further 
input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves, or, 
for advanced players, by creating patterns with particular properties.

---

At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

1.Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by under population.
2.Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3.Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4.Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
